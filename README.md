# Typical-Tasks

Some types of programming tasks are quite often to be seen in the University domain or in Interviews for Jobs. 
This is a small repository with quite famous ones that are attempted to be tackled in `Java` for the sake of education and fun.

It is a bit messy, but all codes for each tasks are stored in the `src` folder, and each class is named after a problem it solves
to resolve. Most tasks are contained inside of one class with a main method that can be executed and
workability of the class can be evaluated on the spot, therefore 
it should be relativelly easy to navigate through them.

The problems described and attempted to be solved are of the most basic type, 
therefore, no additional packages or modules are used in any of the classes
beyond ones that essentially default ones. No `pom` files or `Maven` frameworks
are used.
