# Typical-Tasks

Some types of programming tasks are quite often to be seen in the University domain or in Interviews for Jobs. 
This is a small repository with quite famous ones that are attempted to be tackled in `Java` for the sake of education and fun.

It is a bit messy, but all codes for each tasks are stored in the `src` folder, and each class is named after ONLY 1 SPECIFIC problem it seeks to solve.

The problems described and attempted to be solved are of the most basic type,
therefore, no additional packages or modules are used in any of the classes
beyond ones that are essentially the default one and come with Java with the installations. Meaning no `pom` files or `Maven` frameworks
are used.

Many of the tasks are refrences specifically from the following website: https://code-exercises.com/programming that I stumbled upon once (not a promotion, no affiliation). Other ones come as just typical tasks that are often seen and it is hard to point speicifically where they originated.
