# Typical-Tasks

Some type of programming tasks are quite often to be seen in the University domain or in Interview for Jobs. 
This is a small repository with quite famous ones that are attempted to be tackled in `Java` for the sake of education and fun.

It is a bit messy, but all of the codes for each tasks are stored in the `src`folder, and each class is named after a problem it solves
to resolve. Most tasks are contained inside of one class, so it should be relativelly easy to navigate among them.
